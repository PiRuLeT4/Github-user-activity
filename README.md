# Github-user-activity


### How to run this code: 
- python main.py `<username>` 

Username must be a valid github user. 

#### Output:
- Recent commits
- if the user starred a repo
- if the user recently created a new repo
- if the user forked a repo

I will add more features to the project in the future.
